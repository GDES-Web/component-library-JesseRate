    <p>Page Structure:
        Header: Include a title with the website logo and a navigation menu containing links to various sections of the online bookstore, such as Home, Categories, Bestsellers, and Contact Us.
        Breadcrumb: Implement a breadcrumb navigation to help users understand their location within the website (e.g., Home > Fiction > Book Title).
        Book Information: Display the book's cover image, title, author, price, and a brief description. The cover image should be large enough to be easily recognizable, and the text should be clear and legible.
        Call-to-Action Button: Include a call-to-action button (e.g., "Add to Cart") that allows users to add the book to their shopping cart. Please make sure to change the button using your component library to ensure consistency with other controls on the website.
        Additional Information: Provide an expandable section or tabbed content area that contains further information about the book, such as its publication date, publisher, page count, and ISBN. This information should be easily accessible but not distract from the page's main content.
        Footer: Include links to relevant pages, such as Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Help Center. Also, could you display social media icons for the online bookstore's social media profiles?
        Submission:
        After you complete the product page, please review your work and make sure it meets the requirements outlined in this scope of work. This practice test is meant to help you gain experience building web pages using your custom component library and prepare you for the final assignment.</p>
